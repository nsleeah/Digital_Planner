# GYST Frontend Group Project

## Project Description
As part of the Bright Network Technology Academy (BNTA), our group was tasked with developing the front-end of an API that had already been created by another BNTA group. This project aimed to give us practical experience with working on an unfamiliar API and building the necessary front-end components using React. Our team was tasked with working on the ToDoList API of GYST.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
